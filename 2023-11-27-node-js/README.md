# EpicOS 2023

EpicOS 2023 is a Node.js version of EpicOS created on the 27th of November 2023.

It features an unfinished store/economy system that makes use of a JSON database. I was planning to learn about SQLite to create a proper database but ultimately it wasn't finished. This version includes most of its commands.

This version was replaced by Requests for Multiplayer Piano on the 10th of November 2024.
